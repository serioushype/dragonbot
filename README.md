Dragon bot is general purpose, open-source, customizable bot for discord. Dragon bot can be used without coding at all. Dragon bot only requires Node js.

> ## Features

- Plugins. Plugins can add a lot of new commands, events and other fun stuff. Plugins have full management of your system & bot, so be careful what plugins you choose. But besides that, they are good.
- Launcher. Through launcher you can easily update, install and do more, easily with command line interface.
- Built-in plugins. Built-in plugins include fun and useful commands, such as plugin management, general commands, config management, mod commands, etc..
- Bot moderators. Bot moderators can change some configurations & manage bot only through commands. In plugins, they probably can do much more, if plugin enables it for them.
